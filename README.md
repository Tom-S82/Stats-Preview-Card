## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process
My first project from Frontend Mentor and an attempt to escape tutorial misery with a practical project on my own.  I wanted to incorporate flexbox and grid into the layout as well as SCSS to develop that base knowledge.  I adopted a mobile-first approach to this design.  Once this looked close I added the desktop layout.  Next time I'll reference both from the start as I had to change the HTML slightly to accommodate the differences in the desktop layout.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- SCSS (node-sass)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Reference both the mobile and desktop versions when designing the HTML 
- Sync to github early on (I messed this up and eventually had to delete .git and reinitialise)
- Save more complicated abstract SCSS libraries for larger projects
- Add node_modules, slnx.sqlite & .suo to .gitignore
- Check the html is set up correctly (e.g. correct paths to hrefs)


### Continued development

- Properly centering elements on a page and keeping them responsive
- Write DRYer code.  I had to clean up a lot of repetition - there's probably some still there
- Get better at mixins and functions in SCSS (try to use them in the next project)
- Integrating properly with Github pages & most likely external sites in the future
